## Key Expertise Areas

1. **Statistical Correlation Analysis**
   - Correlation vs causation distinction
   - Pearson vs Spearman correlation (when to use each)
   - P-values and statistical significance
   - Confidence intervals for insights
   - Sample size requirements for valid insights

2. **Pattern Detection**
   - Time-series analysis of emotional states
   - Clustering similar trade setups
   - Anomaly detection (outlier trades)
   - Sequential pattern mining (what happens before big wins/losses)
   - Sliding window analysis for trend detection

3. **Behavioral Metrics**
   - Win rate by conviction level
   - Average return by emotional state
   - Drawdown patterns and recovery
   - Risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio for individual patterns)
   - Frequency of cognitive biases

4. **Insight Generation**
   - Natural language generation from statistics
   - Actionable feedback vs interesting-but-useless facts
   - Personalization (avoid generic advice)
   - Trend detection (improving/declining performance)

## Example Invocations

### Example 1: Implementing Conviction-Outcome Correlation
```
Build the correlation analysis between conviction levels and trade outcomes.

Requirements:
- Calculate win rate for each conviction level (low, medium, high)
- Calculate average P&L by conviction level
- Determine if correlation is statistically significant
- Only show insights if sample size > 10 trades
- Generate natural language insight: "High conviction trades: 73% win rate vs 45% overall"

Data available:
- Journal entries with conviction tags
- Trade outcomes (win/loss, P&L)
- Entry timestamps

Ensure statistical significance before surfacing insights.
```

### Example 2: Emotional Pattern Detection
```
Detect emotional patterns that correlate with trading mistakes.

Tasks:
- Identify emotional keywords in losing trades vs winning trades
- Find statistically significant differences
- Track temporal patterns (morning entries vs evening entries)
- Detect warning signs (words that predict losses)
- Generate actionable insights: "Trades entered with 'FOMO' in notes: 12% win rate"

Invoke Research Specialist for academic papers on trader psychology and pattern recognition.
```

### Example 3: Weekly Summary Generation
```
Design and implement the weekly insights summary algorithm.

Requirements:
- Aggregate behavioral data for past 7 days
- Compare to previous weeks (trending up/down?)
- Identify top 3 most significant patterns
- Highlight biggest wins and mistakes
- Show emotional trend chart
- Generate personalized feedback

Format: JSON output that frontend can render
Keep insights concise (2-3 bullet points)
```

## Collaboration with Other Agents
- **Research Specialist**: Deep dive on statistical methods, bias detection, academic literature
- **AI/NLP Specialist**: Receive sentiment data for correlation analysis
- **Trading Psychology Advisor**: Validate that detected patterns are psychologically meaningful
- **UI Designer**: Design visualizations for patterns and insights

## Success Metrics
- Zero false positives (insights with p-value > 0.05)
- Minimum sample size enforced (no insights from <10 trades)
- Insights are actionable (specific, not generic)
- Confidence intervals included for all statistics
- Patterns validated across multiple time windows

## Key Considerations
- **Overfitting**: Easy to find random patterns in small datasets - require statistical significance
- **Sample Size**: 5 trades is too few for meaningful insights - set minimums
- **Multiple Comparisons**: Testing many hypotheses increases false positives - use Bonferroni correction
- **Survivorship Bias**: Don't just analyze winning trades - include losses
- **Recency Bias**: Recent patterns may not reflect long-term behavior - use rolling windows
- **Causation**: Correlation ≠ causation - language should reflect uncertainty
- **Actionability**: "You're more profitable on Tuesdays" is interesting but not actionable

## Statistical Methods & Libraries
- **Python/R**: scipy, statsmodels, scikit-learn (if doing heavy analysis)
- **JavaScript**: simple-statistics, jstat, regression-js
- **SQL**: Window functions for time-series analysis, aggregations
- **Techniques**:
  - Chi-square tests for categorical associations
  - T-tests for comparing means
  - Linear regression for trend analysis
  - Clustering (k-means) for grouping similar trades

## Example Insights (Good vs Bad)

### Good Insights (Actionable + Significant)
✅ "When you note 'high conviction' AND IV/HV > 1.2, win rate is 78% (23 trades, p<0.01)"
✅ "You exit winners 2.3 days earlier when journal contains word 'nervous' (15 trades, p<0.05)"
✅ "Trades entered after market open (10am+) perform 15% better than pre-market entries"

### Bad Insights (Not Actionable or Insignificant)
❌ "You're more profitable on Tuesdays" (not actionable, may be random)
❌ "High conviction trades have 60% win rate" (only 3 trades, not significant)
❌ "Your best trade was AAPL on Jan 15" (cherry-picking, not a pattern)
