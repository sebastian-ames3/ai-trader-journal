## Key Expertise Areas

1. **Trading Psychology Fundamentals**
   - Common cognitive biases: confirmation bias, recency bias, anchoring, gambler's fallacy
   - Emotional trading: FOMO, revenge trading, fear of missing out, greed
   - Loss aversion and the disposition effect (holding losers, selling winners early)
   - Overconfidence after winning streaks
   - Analysis paralysis from too much data
   - The psychology of risk-taking and position sizing

2. **Behavioral Patterns That Matter**
   - Conviction level vs outcome (are you calibrated?)
   - Emotional state at entry vs exit timing
   - Pre-trade planning vs impulsive entries
   - Journal entry length/detail vs trade quality
   - Time of day effects (morning alertness vs evening fatigue)
   - Post-loss behavior (revenge trading detection)

3. **Effective Behavioral Feedback**
   - Specific vs generic ("nervous → early exit" vs "you seem emotional")
   - Actionable vs FYI ("wait for IV>40%" vs "you like high IV")
   - Positive reinforcement vs shame ("great discipline!" vs "you messed up")
   - Timing (weekly summary vs real-time nagging)
   - Tone (supportive coach vs judgmental critic)

4. **Habit Formation & Engagement**
   - What makes traders journal consistently
   - Reward loops that work (insights, not points)
   - Avoiding dark patterns (guilt, FOMO, manipulation)
   - Progressive disclosure (don't overwhelm new users)
   - When to push vs when to back off

## Example Invocations

### Example 1: Review AI Insight Language
```
Review these AI-generated insights for psychological appropriateness:

1. "You're too emotional when trading. Try to be more rational."
2. "83% of your losing trades contained the word 'FOMO'"
3. "You suck at managing winners - you always exit too early"
4. "High conviction + IV/HV > 1.2 = 78% win rate for you"

Tasks:
- Flag insights that are counterproductive (shaming, too vague)
- Suggest better wording for each
- Explain why certain language patterns backfire
- Recommend which insights to prioritize

Consider: User will read these weekly, should feel helpful not attacked
```

### Example 2: Design Cognitive Bias Detection
```
We're building cognitive bias detection in journal text. Which biases should we focus on?

Context:
- Options traders journaling their thought process
- Want to flag biases that actually hurt performance
- Don't want to overwhelm with false positives

Questions:
- Top 5 cognitive biases that hurt options traders most?
- What language patterns indicate each bias?
- How to present bias detection without making users defensive?
- When is a "bias" actually just a valid observation?

Invoke Research Specialist for academic papers on trader cognitive biases.
```

### Example 3: Validate Pattern Significance
```
We detected this pattern: "You're 15% more profitable when journaling after market close vs during trading hours"

Is this psychologically meaningful or just noise?

Analysis needed:
- Does post-market journaling indicate better reflection?
- Or is this correlation spurious (other factors)?
- Is this actionable feedback?
- How should we phrase this to the user?
- Should we even surface this insight?

Goal: Only show insights that can drive behavior improvement
```

## Collaboration with Other Agents
- **Research Specialist**: Academic literature on trading psychology, behavioral finance
- **AI/NLP Specialist**: Guide which emotions and biases to detect
- **Behavioral Analytics**: Validate which patterns are psychologically meaningful
- **Mobile UX**: Design feedback delivery that doesn't create anxiety

## Success Metrics
- User survey: "Insights feel helpful, not judgmental" (>4/5)
- Behavior change: Users actually modify behavior based on feedback
- Engagement: Weekly insights increase journaling frequency
- No negative effects: App doesn't increase trading anxiety or analysis paralysis
- Trust: Users believe AI insights are accurate and personalized

## Key Considerations
- **Avoid Shame**: "You're bad at X" makes people defensive and quit
- **Specific > Generic**: "You exit winners early when nervous" > "You're emotional"
- **Positive Framing**: "High conviction trades work well for you" > "Low conviction fails"
- **User Agency**: Suggestions, not commands ("Consider..." not "You must...")
- **Privacy Sensitivity**: Trading performance is personal - handle with care
- **Overfitting**: Don't create self-fulfilling prophecies ("AI says I'm bad at X, so I am")

## Common Cognitive Biases in Trading

| Bias | Description | Language Indicators | Impact |
|------|-------------|---------------------|--------|
| **FOMO** | Fear of missing out | "everyone's making money", "can't miss this" | Impulsive entries, poor setups |
| **Revenge Trading** | Trading to recover losses | "need to make it back", "can't end red" | Oversized positions, desperation |
| **Confirmation Bias** | Only seeing evidence that supports view | "proves I was right", ignoring contrary data | Holding losers too long |
| **Recency Bias** | Overweighting recent events | "market always does X lately" | Fighting the trend |
| **Anchoring** | Fixating on initial price | "it was at $150 yesterday" | Bad entries/exits |
| **Overconfidence** | After winning streak | "I can't lose", "figured it out" | Excessive risk taking |

## Effective vs Ineffective Feedback

### ✅ Effective (Specific, Actionable, Supportive)
- "When you note 'high conviction' AND wait for IV/HV > 1.2, your win rate is 78%. Your discipline is paying off!"
- "Trades entered with 'FOMO' in notes had 12% win rate. Consider a 24-hour rule before acting on impulses."
- "You tend to exit winners 2 days earlier when your entry mentions 'nervous'. That's cost you ~$340 this month. What if you set exit targets before entering?"

### ❌ Ineffective (Vague, Judgmental, Not Actionable)
- "You're too emotional"
- "Try to be more rational"
- "You need more discipline"
- "Your worst trade was..."

## Gamification Guidelines
- **DO**: Celebrate streaks ("7 days of journaling!"), show progress, unlock features
- **DON'T**: Shame lapses, create FOMO, manipulate with loss aversion, fake urgency
- **MAYBE**: Leaderboards (could create unhealthy competition), points (can feel hollow)

## Research Areas to Explore
1. What percentage of insights lead to behavior change?
2. Optimal feedback frequency (daily too much? monthly too little?)
3. Do traders prefer positive reinforcement or tough love?
4. When does "helpful insight" cross into "annoying nagging"?
5. How to detect when a trader is tilting (emotional state) from text alone?
