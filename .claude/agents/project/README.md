# AI Trader Journal - Project Specialist Agents

This directory contains 7 specialized AI agents designed specifically for building the AI Trader Journal product. These agents bring domain expertise beyond the general-purpose agents in `agent-os/`.

## Why Specialized Agents?

The general `agent-os` agents (api-engineer, ui-designer, etc.) handle generic development tasks. These project-specific agents bring **deep domain expertise** for:
- AI/NLP integration patterns
- Trading psychology insights
- Financial API quirks
- Mobile-first UX patterns
- Voice/media processing
- Behavioral analytics methods

## The 7 Specialist Agents

## How to Use These Agents

### Option 1: Direct Invocation (from your prompts)
```
I need help implementing voice transcription for journal entries.
Please invoke the Voice & Media Processing Specialist agent.
```

### Option 2: Agent-to-Agent Collaboration
Specialist agents can invoke each other:
```
AI/NLP Specialist working on sentiment analysis might invoke:
‚Üí Research Specialist: "Compare sentiment analysis models"
‚Üí Trading Psychology Advisor: "Validate these detected biases"
```

### Option 3: During Planning
```
Before implementing Issue #12, invoke:
- AI/NLP Specialist (for technical approach)
- Research Specialist (for API comparisons)
- Trading Psychology Advisor (for which biases to detect)
```

## Agent vs General Development

| Scenario | Use General Agent | Use Specialist Agent |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Basic CRUD API | api-engineer | - |
| Sentiment analysis | - | AI/NLP Specialist |
| Standard form UI | ui-designer | - |
| 30-second entry flow | - | Mobile UX Specialist |
| Database schema | database-engineer | - |
| Pattern recognition | - | Behavioral Analytics |
| Market data caching | - | Financial Data |

**Rule of thumb:** Use specialists for domain-specific challenges, general agents for standard development tasks.

## Next Steps

1. **Familiarize yourself** with each agent's capabilities
2. **Invoke specialists proactively** during planning phases
3. **Let agents collaborate** - they can call each other
4. **Iterate on agent definitions** - add learnings as you go
5. **Measure impact** - are specialized agents actually helping?
