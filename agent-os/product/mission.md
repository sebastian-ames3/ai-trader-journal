# Product Mission

## Pitch
AI Trader Journal is a mobile-first options trading journal that helps retail options traders make data-driven trading decisions by providing intelligent volatility analysis that reveals whether options are overpriced or undervalued, enabling traders to consistently identify high-probability trades and manage risk scientifically.s your intelligent trading companion that turns every market observation, trade idea, and execution into actionable insights. It's the journal you'll actually want to use every day—not because you have to, but because it makes you a better trader.

Most traders know they should journal. Few actually do. Why? Because manual journaling is tedious, disconnected from real market data, and offers no feedback. AI Trader Journal solves this by:

Capturing your thoughts seamlessly: Quick-entry notes, voice memos, screenshots—journal however you think
Enriching entries with live data: Automatically snapshots market conditions (IV/HV, spreads, liquidity) when you log trades or ideas
AI pattern recognition: Analyzes your journal over time to surface what actually works for YOUR trading style
Honest feedback: AI reviews your rationale, identifies emotional patterns, and highlights blind spots you'd miss

The volatility analysis and data fetching aren't the product—they're the foundation that makes your journal entries contextually rich. The real magic happens when the AI reads through weeks of your entries and tells you: "You're 73% more profitable when you wait for IV >40% and note 'high conviction' in your rationale."
This replaces your physical journal by giving you something no notebook can: a trading partner that learns from every entry and helps you evolve.

## Users

### Primary Customers
- **Journaling-Resistant Traders**: Traders who know they should journal but find it tedious and unrewarding
- **Self-Improving Options Traders**: Active traders (2-5+ entries per week) who want to understand their edge
- **Pattern Seekers**: Traders who journal inconsistently and want help identifying what actually drives their success

### User Personas

**"The Reflective Trader"** (30-55 years old)
- **Role:** Self-directed retail trader journaling 3-7 times per week
- **Context:** Trades options across multiple strategies; journals trade ideas, actual trades, and post-trade reflections
- **Pain Points:** Hard to see patterns in a physical journal; no way to correlate entries with market conditions; journaling feels like busy work
- **Goals:** Build a database of personal trading insights; identify emotional patterns; understand which setups actually work; get feedback on trade ideas BEFORE executing

**Volatility-Focused Trader** (30-55 years old)
- **Role:** Options trader specializing in volatility strategies (iron condors, strangles, credit spreads)
- **Context:** Running premium-selling strategies that profit from IV/HV mispricings; needs to quickly assess whether IV is elevated relative to realized volatility
- **Pain Points:** Manual IV/HV comparison is tedious and error-prone; historical volatility requires downloading price data and spreadsheet calculations; can't easily track which IV conditions led to profitable trades; no way to review past vol-based decisions
- **Goals:** Systematically identify when IV is inflated vs HV to sell premium; journal trades with complete volatility metrics to refine edge; build a database of what volatility conditions work best for their strategies

## The Problem

### #1 Traders Know They Should Journal, But Don't

Options traders understand that systematic journaling leads to better decision-making and performance improvement. However, most traders fail to maintain consistent journals because:

1. **Manual data entry is tedious**: Recording market conditions, Greeks, spreads, and rationale takes 5-10 minutes per entry
2. **Physical journals provide no feedback**: Writing in a notebook creates a record, but offers zero analysis or pattern recognition
3. **No connection to actual market data**: Journaling thoughts without capturing objective market conditions makes review less valuable
4. **Delayed insights**: Even disciplined journalers struggle to spot patterns across dozens of entries over weeks/months
5. **Emotional blind spots**: Traders can't objectively identify their own psychological patterns, cognitive biases, or emotional trading triggers


### #2 Volatility Analysis is Critical but Inaccessible
Options traders know that comparing Implied Volatility (IV) to Historical Volatility (HV) is essential for determining whether options are overpriced or undervalued. However, most traders lack tools that make this analysis easy. Professional platforms like Bloomberg Terminal cost $20,000+ annually, while retail platforms either don't provide HV data or bury it deep in complex interfaces. As a result, retail traders either skip volatility analysis entirely (leaving edge on the table) or manually calculate HV in spreadsheets (time-consuming and error-prone).

**Our Solution:** AI Trader Journal automatically calculates HV20 and HV30 for any ticker and allows manual IV entry with instant comparison, providing institutional-grade volatility analysis in a mobile-first interface designed for retail traders.

### Trade Journaling Lacks Market Context
Most trade journals focus on basic P&L tracking but fail to capture the market conditions that existed when a trade was opened. Without recording IV levels, HV ratios, and pricing context at entry, traders can't systematically learn what conditions lead to winning trades. They're forced to rely on memory or incomplete notes, making it impossible to identify patterns or refine their edge.

With AI analysis of journal entries combined with automatic market data snapshots:
- AI reads your natural language entries and identifies patterns you'd never spot manually
- Correlates your sentiment/conviction levels with actual trade outcomes
- Flags when you're repeating mistakes or ignoring your own rules
- Surfaces insights like "You exit winners too early when you use the word 'nervous' in your entry"
- Makes journaling rewarding because you get immediate, personalized feedback

### A Journal You'll Want to Use Daily

AI Trader Journal combines three elements that make daily journaling irresistible:

**1. Effortless Entry**
- Quick ticker search → auto-populated market data (price, IV, HV, spreads)
- Voice notes, text entries, or screenshot uploads
- Tag moods, strategies, conviction levels with one tap
- 30-second entries vs 5-minute manual logs

**2. Intelligent Context**
- Automatic snapshot of market conditions at entry time
- Manual IV input + automated HV calculation for instant comparison
- Liquidity and spread data so you never forget execution quality
- Links between trade ideas, actual trades, and post-mortems

**3. AI Coach & Pattern Recognition**
- Weekly insights on your trading behavior patterns
- Identifies correlations: "Your highest conviction trades in low vol environments have 68% win rate"
- Emotional pattern detection: flags when language suggests FOMO, revenge trading, or overconfidence
- Personalized feedback: "You noted 'might be late' on 4 losing trades this month—trust your first instinct"
- Trade idea review: Before you execute, AI reviews your rationale against your historical patterns

### Position Sizing is Arbitrary and Risky
Most traders size positions by asking "how many contracts can I afford?" rather than "what position size aligns with my risk tolerance?" This leads to oversized positions during bull markets and undersized positions when opportunities arise. Without account-level risk management, traders either blow up accounts or miss opportunities.

**Our Solution:** AI Trader Journal enables position sizing based on account risk percentage, ensuring consistent risk exposure across all trades regardless of premium price or account size.

## Differentiators

### Automatic HV Calculation
Unlike basic trade journals that only track P&L, we automatically calculate Historical Volatility (HV20 and HV30) for any ticker using close-to-close log returns methodology. This eliminates manual spreadsheet work and provides instant context for IV analysis.

### IV/HV Comparison at Trade Entry
Unlike most platforms that show IV and HV separately, we directly compare them and highlight whether options are overpriced (IV > HV, good for selling premium) or undervalued (IV < HV, potentially good for buying). This results in faster decision-making and clearer edge identification.

### Comprehensive Market Snapshots
Unlike simple trade logs, we capture complete market state at entry including IV data, HV calculations, Greeks, options chain data, and pricing. This enables traders to retrospectively analyze what conditions led to winning trades, building systematic edge over time.

### Mobile-First Volatility Analysis
Unlike desktop-only platforms like Bloomberg Terminal or ThinkOrSwim, we're designed mobile-first so traders can perform IV/HV analysis and journal trades from anywhere. This results in real-time journaling when ideas strike, not end-of-day data entry.

### Risk-Based Position Sizing
Unlike arbitrary "buy 10 contracts" thinking, we enable position sizing based on account risk percentage. This results in consistent risk exposure and protection against oversized positions that can devastate accounts.
