### Changed
- **Data Layer Architecture**: Refactored to support real API integration
  - Updated `/src/lib/data.ts` to use real Yahoo Finance API with mock fallback
  - Updated `/src/app/api/ticker/route.ts` to use real ticker search
  - Updated `/src/app/api/ticker/[symbol]/route.ts` to use real quote data
  - Refactored `/src/components/ui/HvCard.tsx` to fetch data via API route (prevents client-side Node.js module issues)
- **Caching Strategy**: Implemented smart caching based on market hours
  - Price data cached for 1 hour during trading hours, 24 hours otherwise
  - Ticker info cached for 24 hours
  - Search results cached for 1 hour
  - Automatic stale data fallback when API is unavailable
- **Product Strategy**: Refined mission to emphasize AI journal-first approach (80% AI journaling, 20% vol analysis)
- Updated `agent-os/product/mission.md` to focus on solving journaling friction and behavioral pattern recognition
- Restructured `agent-os/product/roadmap.md` with AI features marked as CRITICAL priority
- Reorganized MVP features into three categories:
  - Core Journal Features (Primary Value - 80%)
  - Market Data Foundation (Contextual Enrichment - 20%)
  - Supporting Features
- Moved options chain display, go/no-go precheck, and CSV import to Phase 2

### Fixed
- **Streak Tracking Error Handling** (commit ca6b4d7)
  - Added all required Settings fields (defaultRisk, accountSize, liquidityThreshold, ivThreshold) to upsert operations
  - Added try-catch error handling to prevent entry creation from failing if streak tracking errors occur
  - Return default values on error to ensure entry creation always succeeds
  - Log errors for debugging without blocking the user flow
- **Options Chain Integration Type Errors** (Issue #50)
  - Fixed TypeScript type assertion for yahoo-finance2 expirations array
  - Added proper type guards for options chain data transformation

### Deprecated
- Mock data system (now used only as fallback when `USE_MOCK_DATA=true` or when Yahoo Finance API fails)

### Closed Issues (Completed/Superseded)
- **Issue #34:** Journaling Streak Tracking & Celebration - âœ… Completed (commits 5433768, ca6b4d7)
- **Issue #4:** IV/HV Comparison Card - Superseded by Issue #54 (Carry Indicator with SELL/BUY signals)
- **Issue #5:** Options Chain Display - Superseded by Issue #50 (Full options chain integration)
- **Issue #6:** Risk-Based Position Sizing - Superseded by Issue #52 (Position risk metrics with strategy detection)
- **Issue #7:** Trade Entry & Snapshot - Superseded by Issues #50-55 (Comprehensive options trading features)

### Technical Notes
- Yahoo Finance free API has rate limits - aggressive caching implemented to minimize API calls
- `yahoo-finance2` package uses Deno shims which require Node.js modules, so it must only be used server-side
- TypeScript type conflicts in `yahoo-finance2` resolved with `@ts-expect-error` annotations and interface casting
- Build process validates TypeScript and ESLint successfully
